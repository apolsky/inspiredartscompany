						<p>Music, movement, balance and the basic dance steps are introduced in a fun, friendly and positive manner. This type of class includes mom or dad or another loved one participating in the class along with your little dancer. Our teachers will keep the music and curriculum moving along while parents take an active role in encouraging, supporting and keeping their little dancer on track. Invite family and friends to watch an in-studio "performance" at the end of the session. Our gift to you: Each dancer will receive a pink tutu and a tiara for their performance. Sessions are 8 weeks.</p>

						<p>Watch your child shine in our specialized program for young dancers. Introduce your child to the basics of movement in this program. Each student will be mesmerized with the basics of ballet, jazz, and tap using props, music, costumes, and games. Each class is 30 minutes. We encourage dancers to take ballet as a base class and add on from there. Most students do all three classes the first year so when it's time to decide on classes going forward they have experienced each genre of dance. Students participate in a recital at the end of the season in June. Each 30 minute class has their own recital dance and costume.</p>
						<p>Ballet is encouraged at a young age to build good habits and to protect the dancer's body. Each student will learn the 5 basic positions as well as other beginner technique. This style of dance emphasizes classical technique, flexibility in movement and strength building.</p>
						<p>Tap is a dance form that is fast paced, involving rhythmic footwork. This class combines timing, sound progressions and performance technique. Students will work on coordination and control.</p>
						<p>Jazz is an upbeat dance form derived from ballet, which incorporates stretching, body isolations, leaps and turns. Jazz is a great class for increasing flexibility and building memory skills.</p>

				<p>Dance should be fun at any age or level. Most kids take dance as an outlet for creativity. Most parents want their children to have fun while getting used to the structure of a classroom setting. Our dancers are empowered, nurtured, and are given opportunities outside the classroom to perform locally in a non-competitive atmosphere. You can choose a variety of classes from our Core Program.</p>

						<p>This competition group is for the more advanced dancer. Dancers who compete at this level might also like to continue with dance through college or even professionally. Make sure that when registering you sign up for the appropriate classes. We have a strict policy in regards to all of our students and parents acting professionally and kindly towards one another. Dance should be fun at any level and teamwork is a must. Note to dancers: You should dance for yourself and compete against yourself even in a more challenging program. Challenge and set goals for the year and try to reach them. Remember that we all have strengths and weaknesses. Do what you can to improve, listen to your body, never give up, and work hard because nothing that is worth it will come easy! You will get a challenge by joining this team, and you will reach your goals if you are persistent.</p>

				<h1>Acting</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="acting">
				<p>Acting one through four will be based on the Stanislavski and Stella Adler acting techniques.  We will explore our life as art.  Pulling from our daily dramatics to create new and exciting works.</p>
				<p>We will introduce Acting I and II (ages 8 to 11) with Improvisation and small group scenes.</p>
				<p>Acting III amd IV (ages 12-15) will always warm up with Improvisational work and move on to scripted works of art, group scenes, and/or monologues.</p>
				<p>As always, depending on the size of the class and their focused interests, each class is open for change to accomodate the students' needs.  Our main goal is to work on inner confidence within the facets of stage work.  What you dream on the inside can always become a reality on the stage.  At the end of each session, we will have a showcase for friends and family.  These showcases will include all of the activites that we have worked on throughout the session.</p>
