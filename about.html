						<h3 class="panel-title">Recital Costume Fee Due Date</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>All costumes must be paid in full by November 1st. If the balance is not paid, costumes will not be ordered.  We order costumes very early in the year due to a slow production/delivery time. Most costumes are made to order and cannot be ordered late. We will not order partial classes due to costumes becoming unavailable when materials are out of stock. For this reason anyone who has not paid for their costume on time will not be allowed to participate in the recital.</p>
						<p><b>Payment plan formula</b>
						A $20.00 deposit is due at registration. Multiply the number of dances times $65.00 - 20.00 &div; 3 = monthly payment.<br>
						Costume payments are made in September, October, and November. This is a breakdown of monthly payments per dancer:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>1 costume - monthly payment = $15.00</li>
							<li>2 costumes - monthly payment = $36.67</li>
							<li>3 costumes - monthly payment = $58.34</li>
							<li>4 costumes - monthly payment = $80.00</li>
							<li>5 costumes - monthly payment = $101.67</li>
							<li>6 costumes - monthly payment = $123.34</li>

We hope you will assist students in packing the night before to allow a stress-free transition from school to dance. We always tell the students to be prepared. Please help them be more responsible for themselves, too! Students like to pass the blame onto parents (It's always your fault, right?! ?) but we try to hold the students more accountable, too!</p>

				<p>"You don't have to be the best dancer at your studio. You love them all the same.  As a mom of a two-left-footed-kind-of-kid who just happened to LOVE dancing, we really appreciate the patience and kindness you showed her at such a young age. She is now a confident young lady with so much talent."</p>

				<p>"It's only been a year with you and my child thinks of you as her hero (along with the rest of your staff.) We are so grateful for your influence on her. She's growing into a beautiful young lady! Takes a village and we are certainly happy you're a part of it."</p>

				<p>"We would follow you anywhere! My daughter would dance in a 5x5 room if it meant that you would be her teacher."</p>

				<p>"We came from a very competitive studio. The competition between parents and kids was upsetting.  Imagine seeing your child coming out of dance class crying! No parent should be PAYING for a 'service' like that.  Only smiles when she leaves from your studio! Thank you for the peace of mind!"</p>

				<p>"We have been to other dance studios in the area and it was like a breath of fresh air coming into your space. The teachers were friendly and professional, and eager to make my child feel welcome in a new setting!!!"</p>

				<p>"Nikki &ndash; You are truly a gem in this industry. You care about the kids, give them constructive criticism in a way that really helps them grow without making them feel insecure. We all saw the difference when you started teaching our children. Many thanks for a wonderful year."</p>

				<p>"Thanks for a great first year for our little one. She loves you and loved her very first year in Miss 'Mickey's' class."</p>

				<p>"My daughter loves dancing with your studio! She can't wait to get there and never wants to leave. That says something!"</p>
